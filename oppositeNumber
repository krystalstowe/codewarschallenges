//Write psuedo code first!
//Psuedo code is the plain language used to talk through the logic of syntax

//I remember the temperate converter from the book being ((9 / 5) * temp + 32)

//How would I write this code?
//Create a form thet allows users to enter in a temperature in Celius or Farenheit.
//Once user enters in the temperature there will need to be a button that says "convert".
//Once user clicks convert the equation will be ran and we will need to return or alert the result onto the screen

//In class psuedo code 
//only on click

//get value out of input

//convert the value

//show the value to user
